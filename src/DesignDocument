LinearEquation Class
    Instance Variables:
        1. x1 which is an int representing the first x coordinate of the user input
        2. y1 which is an int representing the first y coordinate of the user input
        3. x2 which is an int representing the second x coordinate of the user input
        4. y2 which is an int representing the second y coordinate of the user input
        5. slope which is a double representing the slope of the equation
        6. coord1 which is the String representation of the first pair of coordinate points
        7. coord2 which is the String representation of the second pair of coordinate points

    Constructor:
        LinearEquation(String coord 1, String coord 2)
            These will be the 4 points provide by the user and although they enter in a String, I will use a substring method to get the integer values
            Will hold the values of the equations points and store them in their respective variables

    Methods:
        slopeCalc() which will return a String
            this will calculate the slope of the equation and return it in fraction form
            will also calculate the decimal version of the slope and store it in the slope variable

        yInt()  which will return a double value
            this method will calculate the y-intercept of the equation (the b value)

        slopeIntForm() which will return a string
            this will return the expression and put it in slope intercept from (y = mx +b)

        distanceCalc() which will return a double
            this will calculate the distance between the two provide points

        calcThirdPoint(double x3) will return a string
            will solve for the y-value for the provide x-value(which can be a double) and return it in coordinate form

        getCoordX1(String coord1) which will return an integer
            will get the integer value of the x1 value

        getCoordY1(String coord1) which will return an integer
            will get the integer value of the y1 value

        getCoordX2(String coord2) which will return an integer
            will get the integer value of the x2 value

        getCoordY1(String coord2) which will return an integer
            will get the integer value of the y2 value

        toString() will return an object's value as a String

EquationRunner Class:
    1. Prompt the user for their name and store it as a variable name (String)
    2. Greet the user with their name and ask them to enter their two coordinate values
        a. will store both these coordinate values as coord1 and coord2 respectively (both are Strings)
    3. Instantiate a new object using the LinearEquation constructor
    4. Print the first coordinate pair (coord1)
    5. Print the second coordinate pair (coord2)
    6. Print the slope of the line by calling the slopeCalc() method
    7. Print the Y-intercept by calling the yInt() method
    8. Print the Slope intercept form by calling the slopeIntForm() method
    9. Print the distance between the two points by using the distanceCalc() method
   10. Ask the user to enter a third coordinate point and store that as a variable called x3 (double)
   11. Print the coordinate pair of that x3 by calling the calcThirdPoint() method
   12. Lastly I will include a rounding method to round all the numbers to hundredths place
